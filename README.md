# Windows Performance Application
- Requires .NET Framework 6.0 (Windows 11)

- You may get a false postive from your AV, this is because this program makes system changes that Windows does not like

# Features

# WARNING
- Changing the Windows system is not 100% safe. PLEASE MAKE A RESTORE POINT BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM!

- From personal experience, CMD Tweaks has improved my performance but caused a lot of instability so I do not use that on my own system. Everything else works wonderfully. THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME CASE FOR YOU!
